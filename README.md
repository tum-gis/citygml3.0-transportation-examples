# General information
This repository contains sample datasets for the CityGML3.0 Transportation Model. It is explained how the data was generated and examples are shown to illustrate new concepts. 
The provided data is based on the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) CityGML Standards Working Group (SWG) CityGML version 3.0 Conceptual Model. https://github.com/opengeospatial/CityGML-3.0CM

# Content
## Simple Intersection
Street space objects are manually derived form a digital orthophoto (DOP20) and exported as .shp files using the software ArcMap10.7. The data is then transformed into several CityGML datasets.
*	CityGML2.0 Transportation dataset demonstrating XLink concept
*	CityGML3.0 Transportation dataset demonstrating the new data structure 
*	FME Workspaces

## Streetspace Model of New York City
*	A CityGML3.0 Transportation sample dataset of central Manhattan generated from CityGML2.0 data using the software FME2019.2.
*	FME Workspaces

## TUM Transportation CityGML V3
*	A CityGML3.0 Transportation sample dataset of an intersection near TU Munich. Including Roads, Sections, Intersections, TrafficAreas and AuxiliaryTrafficAreas.
